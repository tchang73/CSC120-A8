Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
It is a robot who can fly, walk, and grab and store things in an arraylist, and also drop/remove things from the arraylist. It also decreases its battery whenever it is doing an action, and charges when it is out of battery.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
checkBattery method to check the battery level.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Even though I did not work with anyone on this assignment, I did brainstorm with a friend for a bit, especially for certain methods in the Contract that I was not sure how to implement. Talking with someone has definitely been a consistent plus in all of my assignments, which is what I would highly recommend anyone to do.
